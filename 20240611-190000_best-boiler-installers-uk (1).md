## Finding the right installer

![how to find the best boiler installers and fitters in the UK in 2024](/images/mdcms/finding-the-right-boiler-installer.jpg)

Choosing the right installer is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of your new boiler. Here are the steps to ensure you make the best choice:

1.  **Confirm Gas Safe Registration**
    
    Ensure your installer is Gas Safe registered to comply with UK regulations.
    
<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Installer Requirement:</th>
        <th>Details:</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Gas Safe Registration</td>
        <td>Mandatory for all gas engineers in the UK. Check the Gas Safe Register online.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

2.  **Research Customer Reviews**
    
    Look into previous customer reviews to gauge the quality of the installer‚Äôs work.

-   Websites like Trustpilot and Google Reviews provide unbiased feedback.
-   Look for common themes in reviews about timeliness, professionalism, and effectiveness.

3.  **Verify Qualifications and Experience**
    
    Confirm that your installer has the relevant qualifications and a track record of experience.
    
<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Qualification Requirement</th>
        <th>Details</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Boiler Installation Certification</td>
        <td>Essential for ensuring expertise in handling installations.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Years of Experience</td>
        <td>More years often indicate more reliability and skill. Aim for installers with 5+ years of experience.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

4.  **Conduct Cost Comparisons**
    
    Compare quotes from multiple installers.

-   Obtain at least three quotes to ensure a competitive price.
-   Consider what's included in each quote to avoid hidden costs later.

5.  **Ask for Warranties and Insurance**
    
    Ensure your installer offers a warranty on their work and carries insurance.
    
<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Warranty and Insurance</th>
        <th>Details</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Workmanship Warranty</td>
        <td>Typically ranges from 1-5 years for peace of mind.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Liability Insurance</td>
        <td>Covers any damage during installation; should be standard.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

6.  **Check Brand Partnerships**
    
    See if the installer partners with reputable boiler brands, as this often indicates quality and ongoing training.

## Stick to your price range

![stick to your price range when considering boiler installers](/images/mdcms/stick-to-your-price-range-for-boiler-installer.jpg)

Sticking to your budget is crucial to avoid unexpected expenses. Here are steps to take to ensure you stick to your price range:

1.  **Request Fixed-Price Quotes**
    
    Many reputable companies like Boiler Central, Boxt, Heatable, and iHeat offer fixed-price quotes. This ensures no surprise costs arise during installation.

2.  **Avoid Variable Pricing**
    
    Fixed pricing is vital. Variable quotes might lead to unexpected hikes if additional labour or equipment is required.

3.  **Check for Warranties**
    
    Warranties often indicate quality. A good warranty not only improves cost-effectiveness but can save you from potential future expenses. Most companies offer a 10-year warranty, but Boiler Central provides up to 12 years with 2 additional years from the manufacturer.

4.  **Understand Warranty Conditions**
    
    Keeping your warranty valid usually requires annual servicing and timely registration. This minimal annual expense helps maintain long-term cost savings.

5.  **Consider Total Costs Including Finance Options**
    
Finance options can affect overall costs. Compare offers and choose one that fits your budget.

<hr>

## What about installer aftercare?

![stick to your price range when considering boiler installers](/images/mdcms/what-about-aftercare.jpg)

Ensuring that your boiler installer offers comprehensive aftercare services is crucial for long-term satisfaction. Here are the key aspects to consider:

1.  **Service Plans**
    
    Top installers often provide various service plans. Check if these include annual maintenance, emergency call-outs, and priority service.

2.  **Warranty and Guarantee**
    
    Confirm the warranty period and what it covers. Longer warranties typically indicate better quality and reliability.

3.  **Customer Support**
    
    Evaluate their customer support. Efficient customer service can save a lot of hassle if issues arise.

4.  **Partnerships with Manufacturers**
    
    Installers partnered with top manufacturers usually have better access to genuine parts and specialised knowledge.

Making sure your chosen installer excels in aftercare will provide peace of mind and future-proof your investment. Checking customer reviews, understanding service package details, and comparing options will aid in your decision.
